#### Popover.Backdrop

- Renders a Pressable component. Useful to add click outside to close functionality.

- Accepts all [Pressable Props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable#props).

#### Popover.Content

- Pass the popover content as children here.

#### Popover.Arrow

| Props    | Type      | Required | Default | Description                                                    |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| height   | number    | No       | 10      | Arrow height                                                   |
| width    | number    | No       | 16      | Arrow width                                                    |
| color    | string    | No       | #000    | Arrow color                                                    |
| style    | ViewStyle | No       | -       | Style will be passed to the View which is used as Arrow        |
| children | ReactNode | No       | -       | Supply custom Arrow. Make sure the arrow is pointing upward. â–² |


#### OverlayProvider
- When using mode="tooltip", we use custom Portal so it doesn't shift accessibility focus when opened. To use this Portal, we need to wrap the app with OverlayProvider.

```
import { OverlayProvider } from 'react-native-popper';

function App() {
    return <OverlayProvider>{/*Your app*/}</OverlayProvider>
}

```

Phew, That's it!

## Accessibility

### Web

#### ARIA attributes

- If the mode is set to 'popover', the Popover.Content element has role set to dialog. If the mode is set to 'tooltip', the Popover.Content has role set to tooltip.
- The trigger has aria-haspopup set to true to denote that it triggers a popover.
- The trigger has aria-controls set to the id of the Popover.Content to associate the popover and the trigger.
- The trigger has aria-expanded set to true or false depending on the open/closed state of the popover.

#### Behaviour

- When the popover is opened, focus is moved to the first focusable element inside Popover.Content. If you set `autoFocus` to false, focus will not return.
- When the popover is closed, focus returns to the trigger. If you set `restoreFocus` to false, focus will not return.
- Hitting the Esc key while the popover is open will close the popover. If you set `isKeyboardDismissable` to false, it will not close.
- Focus will be contained within the Popver.Content. If you set `trapFocus` to false, it will not be contained.

### Examples
- Checkout examples directory. It has a lot of examples including animations.
```
cd examples
<!--  Install dependencies -->
yarn
<!-- run on web -->
yarn web
<!-- run on iOS -->
yarn iOS
<!-- run on Android -->
yarn android
```
### <a name="mode"/>Mode
- Wrap the entire app with OverlayProvider
- mode prop accepts "popover" and "tooltip" values. Tooltips don't shift or trap focus when mounted on web. Also, when mode="popover", it uses RN's built-in Modal on mobile instead of using a custom Portal since it automatically shifts accessibility focus to first element.
- I am still figuring out if we can use a single Portal component and achieve the same.


### Tradeoffs

- I am still figuring out how to support fully configurable entry/exit animation configs.
- However, I'll be adding some common animation examples which one can copy paste and tweak as needed.



### Known issues

- When on="hover" is passed and Backdrop is used, it may lead to flickers as Backdrop hijacks pointer events, so trigger will lose hover. To mitigate this, either set pointerEvents= "none" on backdrop or remove backdrop completely. I am looking how to handle this in a more simple way.
