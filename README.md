[Playground](https://react-native-popper.netlify.app/)
[Popover Example](https://snack.expo.io/gCAgexV36)
[Tooltip Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/tooltip-example-wgrfd) - (CodeSandbox - as we need react-native-web 0.15+ for hover events.)


## Features
- Includes Popover and Tooltip.
- Fully customizable.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Handles focus trap, autofocus and dismiss on Escape on web.
- Shifts accessibility focus to first item on Android and iOS.
- Has "multiple" mode which can be used to open multiple popovers.

### Popover.Backdrop or Tooltip.Backdrop

- Renders a Pressable component. Useful to add click outside to close functionality.

- Accepts all [Pressable Props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable#props).

### Popover.Content or Tooltip.Content

- Pass the popover content as children here.

### Popover.Arrow or Tooltip.Arrow

| Props    | Type      | Required | Default | Description                                                    |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| height   | number    | No       | 10      | Arrow height                                                   |
| width    | number    | No       | 16      | Arrow width                                                    |
| color    | string    | No       | #000    | Arrow color                                                    |
| style    | ViewStyle | No       | -       | Style will be passed to the View which is used as Arrow        |
| children | ReactNode | No       | -       | Supply custom Arrow. Make sure the arrow is pointing upward. â–² |


### OverlayProvider
- When using mode="multiple" or Tooltip, we use custom Portal to prevent shifting accessibility focus when opened. 
To use this Portal, we need to wrap the app with OverlayProvider.

```
import { OverlayProvider } from 'react-native-popper';

function App() {
    return <OverlayProvider>{/*Your app*/}</OverlayProvider>
}

```

Phew, That's it!

## Why Popover and Tooltip separate component?
**Reason**: Different Accessibility requirements.
- For Tooltips, we add aria-describedby on trigger and role="tooltip" on the Tooltip content and default "on" prop is set to "hover".
    - On Android/iOS we use custom Portal, so it doesn't shift accessibility focus.
- For Popovers, we add aria-controls on trigger and role="dialog" on it's content. Also, Popover comes with focus trapping options. 
    - On Android/iOS, we use RN's build in Modal which shifts the accessibility focus to first element. Also, refer [mode section](#mode)

## Examples
- Checkout examples directory. It has a lot of examples including animations.
```
cd examples
// Install dependencies
yarn
// web
yarn web
// iOS 
yarn iOS
// Android
yarn android
```
## <a name="mode"/>Mode
- Mode prop accepts `single` and `multiple` values. Defaults to `single`.
- When set to `single`, it uses RN's built-in Modal which shifts accessibility focus to the first element when opened. 
- RN's built in modal doesn't support multiple popups at once unless they are nested. If you need multiple popup support without nesting use mode="multiple".
- To use mode="multiple", wrap the entire app with OverlayProvider which enables custom Portal like functionality.
- I am still figuring out if we can make this simple.

## Limitations

- Currently we have built in fade animation support. I am still figuring out how we can extract the layout info and use it to provide custom animation config externally. This can be useful when you want to animate depending upon popover content dimensions. 

## Known issues

- When on="hover" is passed and Backdrop is used, it may lead to flickers as Backdrop hijacks pointer events. To mitigate this, either set pointerEvents= "none" on backdrop or remove backdrop completely. I am looking how to handle this in a more simple way.


## Accessibility

### Web

#### ARIA attributes

- If the mode is set to 'popover', the Popover.Content element has role set to dialog. If the mode is set to 'tooltip', the Popover.Content has role set to tooltip.
- The trigger has aria-haspopup set to true to denote that it triggers a popover.
- The trigger has aria-controls set to the id of the Popover.Content to associate the popover and the trigger.
- The trigger has aria-expanded set to true or false depending on the open/closed state of the popover.

#### Behaviour

- When the popover is opened, focus is moved to the first focusable element inside Popover.Content. If you set `autoFocus` to false, focus will not return.
- When the popover is closed, focus returns to the trigger. If you set `restoreFocus` to false, focus will not return.
- Hitting the Esc key while the popover is open will close the popover. If you set `isKeyboardDismissable` to false, it will not close.
- Focus will be contained within the Popver.Content. If you set `trapFocus` to false, it will not be contained.

### Android/iOS

- When mode is set to `popover`, accessibility focus will be automatically shifted to first element. [Check out this demo](https://twitter.com/nishanbende/status/1373699977801703424).
