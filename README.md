#### Popover.Backdrop

- Renders a Pressable component. Useful to add click outside to close functionality.

- Accepts all [Pressable Props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable#props).

#### Popover.Content

- Pass the popover content as children here.

#### Popover.Arrow

| Props    | Type      | Required | Default | Description                                                    |

| children | ReactNode | No       | -       | Supply custom Arrow. Make sure the arrow is pointing upward. â–² |

Phew, That's it!

### Tradeoffs

- I am still figuring out how to support fully configurable entry/exit animation configs.
- However, I'll be adding some common animation examples which one can copy paste and tweak as needed.

## Credits

- This library is built on top of [useOverlayPosition](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useOverlayPosition.html) which is a customized version of [useOverlayPosition](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useOverlayPosition.html) from Adobe's React ARIA.

## Accessibility

### Web

#### ARIA attributes

- If the mode is set to 'popover', the Popover.Content element has role set to dialog. If the mode is set to 'tooltip', the Popover.Content has role set to tooltip.
- The trigger has aria-haspopup set to true to denote that it triggers a popover.
- The trigger has aria-controls set to the id of the Popover.Content to associate the popover and the trigger.
- The trigger has aria-expanded set to true or false depending on the open/closed state of the popover.

#### Behaviour

- When the popover is opened, focus is moved to the first focusable element inside Popover.Content. If you set `autoFocus` to false, focus will not return.
- When the popover is closed, focus returns to the trigger. If you set `restoreFocus` to false, focus will not return.
- Hitting the Esc key while the popover is open will close the popover. If you set `isKeyboardDismissable` to false, it will not close.
- Focus will be contained within the Popver.Content. If you set `trapFocus` to false, it will not be contained.
